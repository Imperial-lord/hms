 A Hospital Management System (HMS) is a software application that helps manage the information related to health care and track patients through their treatment journey. On the scale of a country as large and diverse as India, the problem requires innovative, scalable solutions. Creating a network of approved hospitals, HMS will provide the ability to manage all the records in one place, visualize a patient’s medical history, allow doctors to manage patients better by automating manual workflows (example, automating the generation of medical bills and preparing the medicines in the hospital’s dispensary based on doctor’s appointment conclusion).
